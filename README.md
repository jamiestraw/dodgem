## TODO

- [ ] Add filter to `scrapeTrades()` that filters out any trade listings that are in the 15 minute cool-off period
- [ ] Remove nasty `timeout` hack in puppeteer navigation requests (for some reason `pageload` takes over 1 minute to fire sometimes)
- [ ] Finish `mode` implementation with configurable interval for `drip` mode etc.
- [ ] Add robust error handling & logging
- [ ] Create nice `README.md`
